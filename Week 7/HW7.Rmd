## Assignment â€“ Working with XML and JSON in R

This assignment involves importing different data sources into R.  Three files were generated:
<li>JSON - Books.json</li>
<li>XML - Books.xml</li>
<li>HTML - Books.html</li>

Each one handling a different file format.  Three books were imported into each file including "I, Robot", "Brave New World", and "The Talisman."

The files were generated using Notepad++.

## Importing the Data

The HTML and XML file was imported using the XML library file and the JSON file was imported using the jsonlite program.

```cpp
// Import and Parsing Data
library(jsonlite)
library(XML)

#Import Json
JSONBooks <- fromJSON("CesarBooks.json", flatten=TRUE)
class(JSONBooks)
colnames(JSONBooks)

#Import XML
XMLBooks=xmlParse("CesarBooks.xml")
class(XMLBooks) 

#Import HTML
HTMLBooks<-readHTMLTable('CesarBooks.html', header = TRUE)

# Replace all \n by spaces
class(HTMLBooks) 
```

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
library(XML)
library(knitr)

#Import Json
JSONBooks <- fromJSON("CesarBooks.json", flatten=TRUE)
class(JSONBooks)
colnames(JSONBooks)

#Import XML
XMLBooks <- xmlTreeParse("CesarBooks.xml")
XMLBooks <- xmlRoot(XMLBooks)
XMLBooks <- xmlSApply(XMLBooks, function(x) xmlSApply(x, xmlValue))
XMLBooks <- data.frame(t(XMLBooks),row.names=NULL)
class(XMLBooks) 

#Import HTML
HTMLBooks <- readHTMLTable('CesarBooks.html', header = TRUE)

# Replace all \n by spaces
class(HTMLBooks) 
```

## Structures of Each File

Each file is imported by R in different formats.

```cpp
// See the structre of each file.
class(JSONBooks)

class(XMLBooks) 

class(HTMLBooks) 

library(knitr)
kable(head(JSONBooks), caption = "Table 1. JSON Table")

kable(head(XMLBooks), caption = "Table 2. XML Table")

kable(head(HTMLBooks), caption = "Table 3. HTML Table")
```
```{r structure, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, include=TRUE}
class(JSONBooks)

class(XMLBooks) 

class(HTMLBooks) 
```


```{r tables, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, include=TRUE}
class(JSONBooks)

class(XMLBooks) 

class(HTMLBooks) 

library(knitr)
kable(head(JSONBooks), caption = "Table 1. JSON Table")

kable(head(XMLBooks), caption = "Table 2. XML Table")

kable(head(HTMLBooks), caption = "Table 3. HTML Table")
```

## Are they identical?

```{r identical, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, include=TRUE}
identical(JSONBooks, XMLBooks)
identical(JSONBooks, HTMLBooks)
identical(XMLBooks, HTMLBooks)
```

None of these frames are identical.
