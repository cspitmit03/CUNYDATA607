## Background

In Social Selling, there are times when specific groups of people purposely decide to join a business opportunity with the intent of generating quick money before being detected by corporate.

This is particularly common when companies are young and don't have the capabilities or staff to catch fradulent behavior before it happens.  

The goal is to predict potential fraud by taking into account specific variables from various tables including Orders, Recruiting History and Location in the Tree Structure.

## MSSQL and Picking Variables

The data to be analyzed is transactional data that lives in MSSQL for corporate.    
From there, other variables where generated from items found inside of this such as country, months in the business, and averages of specific variables month over month.

## Open Connection to SQL and Store Data

```cpp

pwd <- "And@13579"
# Use a full connection string to connect to a SAMPLE database

AR <- odbcConnect("404-sql1.vm.epicservers.com", uid=user.name, pwd=pwd)
```

## Open Connection to SQL and Store Data

```cpp
Downline <- sqlQuery(AR, "
                   SELECT * FROM dbo.SVM
                   where CustomerStatusID <> 'Other'
                   ")

#data review
library(ggplot2)
qplot(APE, AHighKit, data=Downline, colour=CustomerStatusID, size=I(4))

odbcClose(AR)
```
## Show Comparison of Entry Level and Personally Enrolled

The following is a graphic showing those that were terminated due to fraud detection after the fact.

## Developing SVM to Attempt Prediction
<font size="4">
The following R code helps determine if I can predict a fraud case by labelling them as terminated.
The original data set had 34 cases of terminated but with the SVM model, we aren't able to predict them.
They turn up as Active (no fraud).
</font>

```{r SMV, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(e1071)
attach(Downline)
Downline <- Downline[c(2:11)]
x <- subset(Downline, select=-CustomerStatusID)
y <- CustomerStatusID
svm_model <- svm(CustomerStatusID ~ ., data=Downline)
pred <- predict(svm_model,x)

head(table(pred,y))
```

## Summary
<font size="4">
The model had 34 original terminate (fraud) cases which is 1.5% of the dataset.  When using SVM to predict this it is unable to becasue in it's mind it has successfully predicted ~99% of the cases.  

The model although techincally correct wouldn't be able to fit the needs of the question we are trying to answer.  Can I predict fraud (terminate) based upon existing cases.  has a 99%+ 'accuracy' and therefore require using a different method.  The next step when time permits would be to apply the methods learned from “Mini Lecture: Social Network Analysis for Fraud Detection,” Véronique Van Vlasselaer, https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=28&v=6H5Lp3i05Cg, video: 34 minutes, Nov 25, 2013.
